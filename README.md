# Smart City MÃ¼nster Dashboard

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/a3b0b564-6d90-4bbf-9b5f-2f5fd46d5a97/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/smart-city-dashboard/deploys)

This project contains the source code of the frontend of the smart city dashboard. The display can connect to the [backend](https://github.com/reedu-reengineering-education/smart-city-dashboard-backend) and shows different kinds of environmental and smart city related data. The dashboard contains three different pages: dashboard view, map view and an info page.

### Running the project

1. Clone the repo
2. `cd smart-city-dashboard`
3. `cp .env.example .env`
4. Change the env variable `REACT_APP_API_URL` to the URL of the backend
5. `yarn` or `npm install`
6. `yarn build` or `npm build`
7. Serve the `build` folder with your favorite webserver

### Development

The same as "Running the Project" but instead of steps 6 and 7 do the following:

6. `yarn start` or `npm start`

#### Technology

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The frontend is written in [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and uses [react](https://reactjs.org/). State management is done with [redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [redux-saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/). The page style and layout is done with [bulma](https://bulma.io/), while components are styled with [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/). Data visualization on the dashboard is either custom written (e.g. parking) or visualized with [apexcharts](https://apexcharts.com/) (e.g. charts).

#### Dev Technology

We are using typescript for type safety. In order to have consistend formatting / styling of the code, we are using [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/), [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) and [prettier](https://prettier.io/).

#### File Structure

- `.vscode` Settings when developing with VSCode
- `public` Static files that will be served as is
- `scripts` Scripts for maintaining the project
- `src` Source code. This also includes the react entry point, service workers and types
  - `actions` Redux actions (splitted for each data source)
  - `components` React Components
  - `pages` Pages of the website
  - `reducers` Redux reducers (splitted for each data source)
  - `resources` Assets that will be compiled (like icons, images etc)
  - `sagas` redux sagas (Sagas are implemented using Generator functions)
  - `views` Containers that display data (splitted for each data source)

#### Available Visualizations

- Tile: Displaying numbers with units and titles in tiles / cards
- Progress: Visualizing progress which is here used to show the utilization of parking decks
- Line diagram: visualizing (multiple) lines in a diagram

#### How to add a new data source

If you want to add a new data source to the dashboard, there are multiple steps neccessary:

1. Start in the `src/reducers` folder and create a new reducer similar to the existing ones. Here, you will also define the state for your particular dataset
2. Next one, create corresponding actions for your data in the `src/actions` folder
3. After defining how the data should be stored and managed, we can take care of fething the data. Create a new saga in the `src/sagas` folder similar to the existing files. The generator functions will fetch data regularly based on the interval you can define

#### Show the data on the dashboard

1. The most labour will take place in `src/views` where you create a new container for your data. Here, you need to access the redux state and render different kinds of visualizations
2. You can now import your container in `pages/Home` to display it on the main page. You might need to adjust the overall page layout here
