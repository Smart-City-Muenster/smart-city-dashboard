    genericName: Smart City Dashboard
    longDescription: |
      This dashboard is an information service provided by the Smart City staff
      unit of the City of Münster. The dashboard ("dashboard" or "cockpit")
      visualizes real-time data collected in and for various urban development
      topics by the city of Münster and its partners.


      ​


      The dashboard and the corresponding sensor network are to be further
      expanded step by step. In the future, these live data can be used to
      provide an overview of, for example, air quality, other environmental data
      or mobility offerings. On the basis of real-time data and interactive time
      series, it will be possible, for example, to analyze the effectiveness of
      measures in urban areas.


      ​


      The interactive map display provides information on the respective
      locations of the data collection. Information and contact persons for the
      individual topics can be found by clicking on "About the data" at the
      respective topic tile. All data is also available as Open Data for other
      purposes via the Open Data portal of the City of Münster.
