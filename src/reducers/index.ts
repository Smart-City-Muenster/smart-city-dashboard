/**
 * The recommended pattern is to split reducer logic based on the slices of your state.
 * Because this is common, Redux provides a utility called combineReducers
 * to make it easy to define which slice reducers are responsible for each slice of state.
 *
 * In our input object we omit the key values that define the slices of the state but
 * directly use the integrated function from the single reducer files (reducers/aasee.ts, ...)
